# Guide to Academic Conferences

*(Adapted from the Columbia WiCs Organization’s “All about Conferences” Page)*

## Why Attend Conferences?

- **Networking:** Meet faculty at Columbia or other universities, speak with other researchers, and meet potential PhD advisors!
- Learn about current problems in your field
- **Improve your communication** in technical talks & poster presentations
    - For students interested in graduate research or a PhD, conferences let master’s students practice communicating research, build visibility, and make connections that directly influence PhD opportunities

## Resources for Presentations

Academic poster talks involve presenting research visually on a large poster during a designated session at a conference (often involves focused conversations with attendees). Conference talks are oral presentations where a researcher speaks to a larger audience and gives a structured presentation of their work. Both formats are for sharing research and receiving feedback.
