# Max Planck – New York Center for Non-Equilibrium Quantum Phenomena

- Partner of the [Columbia University Quantum Initiative](Columbia%20Quantum%20Initiative%20261a2142cede809a8eedde6c4c8b453d.md)

## About

> *The Center’s mission is to advance one of the most dynamic areas in physical sciences: the control of non-equilibrium quantum phenomena in complex materials. Researchers focus on harnessing and manipulating the unique properties of quantum systems, with particular emphasis on non-linear light-matter coupling that creates phases with no equilibrium counterparts. By combining experimental and theoretical approaches, the Center is pushing the boundaries of quantum materials research.*
